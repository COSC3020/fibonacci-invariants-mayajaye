# Fibonacci Invariants

Recall the definition of the Fibonacci series: the first number is 0, the second
1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two numbers preceding it.
Implement a function that computes the Fibonacci numbers recursively, storing
the results in an array.

For example, the return value of `fib(7)` is the following array:

| index |  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| value |  0  |  1  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  5  |  8  |  13 |

Add your code in `code.js`. Test your new function; I've provided some basic
testing code that uses [jsverify](https://jsverify.github.io/) in
`code.test.js`.

## Invariant

What is a good invariant for your recursive implementation of `fib()`
i.e. something that is always true at the beginning of the recursive call?

Hint: Think about what the "state of the world" is here and what you can say
about it at the start of each recursive call. Your invariant must say something
about the current recursive call.

Describe your reasoning and the conclusion you've come to. Your reasoning is the
most important part. You do not need to prove that the invariant is correct. Add
your answer to this markdown file.

An invariant for this implementation of a fibonacci function would be that for any natural number n, the fibonacci function will return the nth fibonacci number, and all fibonacci values up to n that have already been computed will be used to correctly compute the next values up to n. This invariant helps us prove the function correct by stating that each recursive call correctly computes the nth fibonacci number by using the previously correctly computed values. The first two previously computed values are the base cases of 1 and 0, which we know the fib values of. Fib(2) will be computed using the correctly computed base cases so that each value after that will be correctly computed using the two previous values stored in the array.
