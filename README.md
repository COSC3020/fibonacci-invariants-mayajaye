# Fibonacci Invariants

Recall the definition of the Fibonacci series: the first number is 0, the second
1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two numbers preceding it.
Implement a function that computes the Fibonacci numbers recursively, storing
the results in an array.

For example, the return value of `fib(7)` is the following array:

| index |  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| value |  0  |  1  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  5  |  8  |  13 |

Add your code in `code.js`. Test your new function; I've provided some basic
testing code that uses [jsverify](https://jsverify.github.io/) in
`code.test.js`.

## Invariant

What is a good invariant for your recursive implementation of `fib()`
i.e. something that is always true at the beginning of the recursive call?

Hint: Think about what the "state of the world" is here and what you can say
about it at the start of each recursive call. Your invariant must say something
about the current recursive call.

Describe your reasoning and the conclusion you've come to. Your reasoning is the
most important part. You do not need to prove that the invariant is correct. Add
your answer to this markdown file.

An invariant for this implementation of a fibonacci function would be that n
is greater than the base case and has yet to be computed. In a basic 
fibonacci implementation (fib(n) = fib(n - 2) + fib(n - 1)), this invariant
does not hold, as many redundant fibonacci values will be computed up to n. 
On the other hand, when this program checks if fib(n) is in the array, it is 
checking if fib(n) has been computed. If it has, the recursive calls will not be 
redundantly executed for n. And of course, n is already 'computed' if it is less
than 2, so n must be greater than the base case for the recursive call to be 
executed.
